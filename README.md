# sharer

Simple file sharer for myself, reasons I made my own tool:
- Fun!
- Educational purposes as it's small but has a lot of tips
- Air drop is not always a solution as Android and Windows don't have it
- Other tools such as LocalSend or ShareIt sometimes don't work!

# How to use
run 
```
go run main.go
```
And you'll get an address like this:
```
192.168.1.113:60
192.168.1.113:60/files
```
